# Referral Program


Our Referral Program allows you to earn real money, that can be spent on buying the VT-Terminal licenses or even be withdrawn on demand. The earning process is simple: you receive **20% from each purchase** sum of your referral. We can increase % depends on our own view!

{% hint style="warning" %}
* Your referral (the person you invited) must **register an account** in our license system **Through Your Link!** Otherwise, he will not be counted as your referral.
* If your referral created a new account (**or changed email**) without your referral link, then his purchases will not be counted in your payments
