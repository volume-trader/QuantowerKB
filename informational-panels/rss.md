### How to add a Custom RSS channel

If necessary, you can add any news source. To do this, specify a link to this source in the connection settings. Here you can see the list of currently available feeds. You can change the name or URL per each feed item. In case you would like to add a new feed, press the **\[ + ]** button on the right top corner of connection settings. This action will add a blank row to the feeds list, where you can set up the required feed access settings.

## Manage news list

Once you have at least one feed in your settings, you will be able to see its news right in RSS panel's table. The table management is as default.

You will find some useful hot buttons on the panel's toolbar. **\[ FEEDS MANAGER ]** button opens a corresponding screen. **\[ CURRENT FEEDS ]** button allows you to filter the viewable news by the feeds. To hide some items from particular RSS feed â€” just uncheck it in Current feeds list.

The **\[ CLEAR HISTORY ]** button removes all of the previously imported news from the table.

{% hint style="success" %}
You may apply the Table actions to the RSS panel. It can be convenient to color some rows, containing the particular word or by the feed source.
