### How to create multiple templates for drawings?

Starting from [VT-Terminal version # 1.126](https://www.quantower.com/release-notes) all drawings have a new option '<mark style="background-color:blue;">**Save as Template**</mark>'. Using multiple templates, a trader can set up drawings with different visual parameters, and switch between them in a couple of clicks.

* Once you have configured the drawing to your own choice, click on <mark style="background-color:orange;">**Save**</mark> icon and select <mark style="background-color:blue;">**Save as Template**</mark> from the dropdown list.
* Set the necessary name for the current template.

* You can also save the template via the context menu of the drawing
