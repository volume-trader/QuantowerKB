# Order placing strategies

Each time you place an order in VT-Terminal â€” you do it immediately by pressing a corresponding button and sending your order to the remote server. This is a usual operation for every trader, but what if you would like to schedule the order sending or split the order's quantity in time. Maybe you would like to apply some non-standard order parameters or order types not supported by your broker?

## Where and how to use it?

Here comes the functionality of Order placing strategies, allowing simple automation of complex order submission. You can find the corresponding control in every Order entry panel or sidebar.
