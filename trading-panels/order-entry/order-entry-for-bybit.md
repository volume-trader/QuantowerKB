* setting of the order price, stop loss and take profit prices;
* order placing strategy for advanced trading algorithms
* information on current Ask and Bid prices, spread size, as well as an order placement button

### Selection of Order Type, Time if Force and Order Quantity

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (290).png>)

You can enter an order volume by specifying the amount in the currency of the quote and as a percentage of the available margin. There are three ways to do this, as described below:

* Enter the desired amount of coins/lots based on the selected trading pair;
* Enter the total amount of the order. This field is very useful when you need to quickly specify the amount of entry into the transaction immediately in the currency of the balance, without recalculating the number of coins on the exchange rate;&#x20;
* Select with the slider the order amount in % of the total maximum available balance taking into account the set leverage.



### TP and SL orders from the OE panel (order entry)

&#x20;Bybit exchange allows users to calculate possible risks even **before opening a transaction (!)** and users can set their goals - TP (Take Profit) and limit losses with SL order (Stop Loss), simultaneously with order entry into position. To do this, on the order entry panel at the same time as setting an order, you can immediately set the necessary parameters TP and SL

The quick change order amount buttons will help you change the specified volume in one click, based on your trading strategy. You can set by default any parameters that you need to quickly change the values. Moreover, the buttons can change not only the specified position volume, but also apply any (!!!) formulas to calculate the order volume. To set your personal values for a quick change of the order, you need to go to the settings of the chart in the menu section "Order entry" and find the field "OE buttons"

### Order parameters - type, TIF, price, algorithmic settings

Time-in-Force (TIF) parameters determine the length of time an order will continue to run before it is canceled. Bybit provides a variety of TIFs:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (288).png>)

* GTC (Good Until Cancelled) - Orders will work until they are cancelled by the trader or the contract expires;&#x20;
* FOK (or Fill or Kill) - the order will be canceled if it is not executed in full as soon as it becomes available; I
* OC (Immediately or Cancel) - requires that any part of the order that has not been executed as soon as it becomes available in the market will be canceled;

### Post-Only

&#x20;When the "Post-Only" option is checked, the order is not executed as a Taker operation, and therefore a Maker's fee is earned when the order is executed. The order "Post-Only" is automatically cancelled if it can be executed immediately against an existing order in the market.

### Reduce-Only&#x20;

Used to reduce the size of a position and does not increase its size.&#x20;

### TP (Take Profit) and SL Stop Limit (Stop Loss) orders&#x20;

Bybit allows users to calculate potential risks before opening a position (!) and users can set their objectives as TP (Take Profit) and SL (Stop Loss) orders, simultaneously with an order to enter the position. To do this, on the order entry panel at the same time as setting an order, you can immediately set the necessary parameters **TP and SL**

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (286).png>)

{% hint style="success" %}
After placing the position, TP and SL can be changed according to the situation directly from the chart by moving the mouse to new levels:
{% endhint %}
