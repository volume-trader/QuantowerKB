# Errors with Interactive Brokers

### Data Limitations

Interactive Brokers places the following limitations on real-time and historical data accessible to 3rd party applications

* **Pacing Violations** – TWS limits the number of requests for data. If too many requests for data occur in a short period of time, you may see error messages indicating “Pacing Violation”. If this happens you may need to wait a few minutes before trying to load data again. 
* **Real-Time Quotes** – TWS does impose limits on the number of active tickers \(typically around 100\). Additional booster packs can be purchased from IB to work around this issue: [Booster Packs](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=14193). 
* **Delayed Data Not Supported** – TWS does not provide access to delayed historical data and quotes. 

### The most common Errors & Issues

Here is the list of the most common errors and issues with IB connection:

* **Error "No market data permissions for NYSE STK"**

## Error "No market data permissions for NYSE STK"

In order to receive market data for charts and quote lines within VT-Terminal, it is necessary you are subscribed to the exchange that the Symbol is listed on. If market data is not subscribed, you will see error messages similar to the following:

In this case you will need to **subscribe to market data** from the particular exchanges mentioned in these messages. After this is done, **restart Trader Workstation platform**. VT-Terminal will establish a new connection and you should then receive market data.
