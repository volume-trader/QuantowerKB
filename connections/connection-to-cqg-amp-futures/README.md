### How to find trading symbols for the CQG connection?

By default, we do not provide a predefined list of symbols (maybe in the next updates we will add default symbols). To find the desired symbol, go to the [**Tradable Symbols**](https://www.cqg.com/partners/exchanges/tradable-symbols) page on the CQG site where you can find a correct ticker. Also, we’ve prepared a list of the most frequent trading symbols for the futures market.

### How to add TRIN, TICK market indicators into Quantower?

CQG provides access to [market indicators via AMP Futures](https://www.ampfutures.com/trading-info/cqg-supported-indexes) that allow you to assess the overall sentiment of the market. **TRIN** and **TICK** are the most popular indicators that can be used to determine the short-term price movement.

**TRIN** shows the ratio between the number of advancing and declining stocks (AD Ratio) to advancing and declining volume (AD volume).

**TICK** shows the difference between the number of stocks trading on upticks and downticks. It uses as an intraday indicator.

#### To get access to these indicators:

* a [**subscription**](https://www.ampfutures.com/trading-info/exchange-data-fees) to this data is required (contact your broker to activate)
* if you already have a subscription, open the connection settings and activate the **CQG Comp** exchange to download these symbols

![Activate the exchange for getting TRIN, TICK indicators in Quantower](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (355) (1) (1).png>)

* Connect to CQG and start typing the name of the required indicator in the symbol search field

### **How to set custom trading sessions for futures on CQG, Rithmic?**

Due to the fact that data providers do not provide information about trading sessions for trading assets, traders may face the problem of incorrect display of [volume analysis data](../../analytics-panels/chart/volume-analysis-tools/) for **Regular trading hours (RTH)** and for **Electronic trading hours (ETH)**. To solve this problem, a trader can set up the necessary sessions for an individual instrument, exchange, or the entire connection to the provider.

As an example, let's set the time of RTH and ETH sessions for CME Indexes:

* Open [<mark style="background-color:blue;">**Sessions Manager**</mark>](../../miscellaneous-panels/sessions-manager.md) panel in the Misc section

![Sessions Manager panel in Quantower](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (359) (1) (1).png>)

* Click the <mark style="background-color:blue;">**Sessions templates**</mark> button on the toolbar and <mark style="background-color:blue;">**Create new**</mark> to open the Session template creation screen.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (357) (1).png>)

* Set up a new template's parameters, such as: **Template's name, Timezone, Session's name, Time** and **Days.** Once you finish setting the sessions template, click the <mark style="background-color:blue;">**Save**</mark> button.

{% hint style="info" %}
Trading hours for RTH / ETH sessions of CME Indexes (ES, NQ, RTY etc.) you can find on [CME Group website](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/equities/sp/e-mini-sandp500.contractSpecs.html).
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Time for RTH session" %}
![Custom trading session for CME Indexes for Regular trading Hours](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (347).png>)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Time for ETH session" %}
![Custom trading session for CME Indexes for Electronic trading Hours](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (352).png>)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Time for full day (RTH+ETH)" %}
![Custom trading session for CME Indexes for full day (ETH+RTH)](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (360).png>)
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

* To assign previously created templates to some symbol, you need to call the Sessions assignment screen by clicking the <mark style="background-color:blue;">**Assign sessions**</mark> button on the toolbar.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (359) (1).png>)

* Apply or switch between different sessions on desired panels (chart, DOM trader, TPO etc.). Just open the panel's settings and find the <mark style="background-color:blue;">**Custom session**</mark> parameter (usually in the General section).
