## Error "Index was outside the bounds of the array"

This error can occur when the Internet connection is weak, or when there is an error during loading the symbol files. _**To solve it, click Back and try to connect again.**_

## Chart Data is incorrect or has gaps

Sometimes, non-market gaps can occur due to a weak Internet connection, a broken connection to your data provider, or other reasons. To solve this problem, **Right-click on the chart** and select **Reload history (server).**

## Can not find a symbol

* Make sure that you typed the correct ticker (symbol) for CQG connection.
* If the symbol is typed correctly, check in the **connection settings** that the required exchange is activated. If the exchange is disabled, you should activate it and then start searching for the desired symbol again.

* If the correct symbol cannot be found even with an active exchange, it is necessary to re-download the list of symbols from the CQG servers. Open the main platform folder and clear the Temp folder where the CQG symbols are stored. Delete the entire CQG folder and reconnect.
