## How to get notifications from Telegram Bot?

Telegram Bot sends notifications about alerts that you have set on active Charts or through a Watchlist. If you don't have any alerts yet, the bot will be in standby mode.

Once your alert is triggered, you will receive a telegram notification with the following text:&#x20;

_**"Alert on ENQM21: price 13,379.00 reached."**_
