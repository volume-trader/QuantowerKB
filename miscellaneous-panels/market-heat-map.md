*   The panel allows displaying data in two modes:

    _**Treemap**_ mode in which the size of the tiles depends on the value of the price or volume change.

    _**Cells**_ show tiles of symbols from largest to smallest value (price or volume change).

    &#x20; — **Replace Watchlist** allows you to delete the current list and add all instruments from the previously saved one
